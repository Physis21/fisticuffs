# World building

## Idea

- A god becomes sentient in a parallel dimension, maybe the previous one died long ago
- He sees a previous god lies dead not far beside him. He doesn't care
- 12th dimension, in ref to M-string theory having 11
- It is similar to a child psychologically.
- Looks like a human, has kind of god powers, and can pull humans into his dimension, but cannot cross into the other dimension of humans.
- It is bored, finds humans (which look like him for some reason) and kidnaps some he likes into his dimension before their death; they believe it is heaven
- In his vicinity, humans become stronger and acquire powers.
- His close allies become sort of demigods and form his pantheon
- A human realizes this god sees humans as only playthings and that life is not eternal for everyone. Plus, he discovers the ancient god's corpse, signifying this god isn't the one true eternal
  - Kills the god and splits his corpses into pieces: god remnants
  - Weapon used: bone knife from the bones of the previous god
  - He throws the god remnants onto earth, in the hopes that the demigods won't find them
  - He hopes humans will find an answer to what he his
- Is found by the other demigods, he is killed in retribution. They panick when they see their god is dead, try to keep the status quo because they are addicted to their newfound power
- They try to stop John Doe from publishing his findings on the 12th dimension
- They also want to recover the fallen god's remnants
